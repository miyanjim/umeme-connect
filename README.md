#PHEV Fuel vs Electric Companion<p>
A comprehensive web-based tool designed to help Plug-in Hybrid Electric Vehicle (PHEV) owners and prospective buyers compare the running costs of driving on fuel versus electricity. Get insights into your breakeven points and analyze cost efficiencies based on various factors.

<b>‚ú® Features</b><p>
Vehicle Selection: Choose from a curated list of popular PHEV models with pre-filled efficiency data.

Custom Inputs: Manually enter fuel efficiency (L/100km), battery efficiency (kWh/100km), electricity price (/kWh),andfuelprice(/L).

Charging Loss Calculation: Option to include a realistic 15% charging loss for accurate electricity cost.

Novated Lease Discount: Apply custom discount percentages to fuel, electricity, or both, simulating novated lease benefits.

Cost Comparison Output: Instant feedback indicating whether electric or petrol is cheaper for your current inputs, along with estimated savings.

Interactive Breakeven Chart: Visual representation of breakeven points across a range of fuel and electricity prices.

Ready Reckoner Table: A matrix table showing the cheaper option (Electric, Petrol, or Similar) for various price combinations.

Anonymous Feedback: A simple, in-app modal to provide bug reports or feature ideas without sharing personal information.

<b>üöÄ How to Use</b><p>
Select a Car or Input Custom Data: Choose a pre-defined PHEV model or enter your vehicle's specific fuel and battery efficiencies.

Enter Current Prices: Input your local electricity price (/kWh)andfuelprice(/L).

Adjust Options: Toggle the "Include 15% Charging Loss" checkbox and experiment with the "Novated Lease Discount" if applicable.

Calculate: Click the "Calculate Breakeven" button to see the updated chart, table, and cost comparison summary.

Analyze Results:

The Cost Comparison Output tells you which mode is cheaper and by how much.

The Breakeven Analysis Chart shows where the costs intersect. Your current prices are marked with a green circle.

The Ready Reckoner Table provides a quick overview of cheaper options across various price scenarios.

<b>üõ†Ô∏è Technologies Used</b><p>
HTML5: Structure of the web application.

Tailwind CSS: Utility-first CSS framework for rapid and responsive styling.

JavaScript (Vanilla JS): Core logic, calculations, and DOM manipulation.

Chart.js: For generating interactive data visualizations (breakeven chart).

Netlify Forms: For anonymous feedback collection (no backend needed, data accessible via Netlify dashboard).

<b>üí° Future & Monetization</b><p>
This tool is currently provided free of charge, aiming to be a valuable resource for PHEV owners. We are continuously exploring ways to enhance its functionality and value. Future plans may include advanced features, broader vehicle data integration, or other premium functionalities that could potentially be offered as part of a paid service.
